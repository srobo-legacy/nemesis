Subject:User account requested
Hello {name},

This email confirms that you've just requested the creation of a user account
with the following details. We've emailed the user so they can activate
their account, but you should let them know as well, since the link will
expire in a couple of days.

Their name is: {pu_first_name} {pu_last_name}
Their username is: {pu_username}
Their registered email address is: {pu_email}
They will be a member of: {pu_team}, in {pu_college}

Once they have activated their account, we'll send you another email confirming
that that has happened. If the link expires before they've activated it,
we'll send you an email to let you know that instead.

If you have any problems getting them started, please contact us via
accounts@studentrobotics.org.

Thanks,

The Student Robotics Team
